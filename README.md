Google Tab Hotkey
================

I use Google search very heavily.
It would save a lot of time if I didnt have to grab the mouse to click the link I want.
The default TAB behavior gets you nowhere fast.
I'd rather scroll through each link by pressing TAB and shift+TAB.
This Chrome/Firefox extension adds that functionality.

## Installation

This isn't on any official stores yet.
You'll have to install it manually from source code.

First, you'll need to clone it down.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acarl005/google-tab-hotkey.git
```

From here, follow the browser-specific instructions to install (either Chrome or Firefox).

### Google Chrome

Install at [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-not-in-the-store).

### Mozilla Firefox

## Internationalization

This is only tested on the Google search page in the US. It may differ on the Google domains in other countries.

## Other Search Engines

This actually works for DuckDuckGo too! Happy to accept PRs for any others if you'd like to add.
